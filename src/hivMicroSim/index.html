<h2>HIV Simulation</h2> 
By Laura Manuel
</table>

<p>This is a simulation of HIV transmission through a sexual network. 
    
<p>Adjust the population dynamics and agent behavior to see how HIV spreads through the model. 

<!-  Note these can't be aref stuff because Java's simple 
     web browser code doesn't know how to handle PDFs etc.
     Just stick to images and HTML files in your links.
